			<h2 id="head-info">Here is a summary of the most important aspects:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li> <h3>Finding his Vocation</h3>
					<p> <b>1583</b>- His father wanted him to become in medicine. Galileo specialized in math, with help
						from Ricc, a family's friend. Ricci was used to practice experimental theory back in those days.
					
						He was attracted by Euclides work, and with no interest in medicine, he re-oriented his studies
						to math. Since then, he felt a Pitagora's follower. As a student he was able to discover the
						law of isochrony of pendulums.
						
						After two years, he returns to his home without a diploma, but with the greatest knowledge 
						and cientific curiosity</p>
				</li>
				<li> <h3>Invention of the telescope</h3>
					<p> <b>1609</b>- He increases his curiosity when one of his oldest students confirms to him the
						existence of a telescope capable to see objects far away. This device was built in Netherlands
						by a glasses maker, <em>Hans Lippershey</em>. Motivated, he starts to build his own telescope. 
						The opposite to the telescope from Netherlands, this one did not affect objects and increases
						6 times it size.
						
						On August 21st, he just had finished his second telescope, that could increase 8 or 9 times the size
						of an object. He made a demonstration in Venecia, on the Campanile, San Marcos square. The crowd was 
						exited, infront of them Murano, at 2 and a half miles from them, they were able to see it just at 300
						meters.</p>
				</li>
				<li> <h3>Moon Watching</h3>
					<p> <b>1610</b>- During autuum on 1610, Galileo continued developing his Telescope. In November,
					he made a device that couls increase the size 20 times and used it to watch the sky. He was able to
					observe the moon phases, and discovered this object was a sphere.
				
					He was able to see and transitory light/shadow that was not regular. </p>
				</li>

				<li> <h3>Proofs of the heliocentric system presented by Galileo</h3>
					<p>According  to Bertrand Russel, the conflict between Galileo and the Catholic Church was a 
						rasoning conflict. The induction was base in the observation of reality, from the scientist, and 
						what was written according the holly bible.

						Within all the proofs presente by Galileo, we have the following:
						<ol>
							<li>Mountains on the Moon</li>
							<li>New Stars</li>
							<li>Sun's Spots</li>
							<li>Jupiter's Satellites</li>
							<li>Venus's Phases</li>
							<li>Change of tides</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li> <h3>Last Years</h3>
					<p> <b>1638</b>- Galileo remains confined at his home, receiving some visitors. This allows him
						to keep working on his theories
						
						In Januaty 2nd, 1638, Galileo looses his sight. He dies when he was 77 years old.</p>
				</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Tribute</h3>
			<p>The scientific community has expressed during all these years their position in regards to Galileo and
			the Catholic Church. 

			The church in Galileo's time, was attended to use the reason than Galileo, he did not take into considetation
			the impact this would create in the ethical and social matters. The sentence for Galileo was fair just for
			political matters.
			Inside the scientific community these days, Galileo is considered the father of a lot of theories that have been 
			modeling what science is right now.
